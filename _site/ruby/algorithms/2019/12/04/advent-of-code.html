<p>Iâ€™m doing <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of code</a> this year again ðŸŽ„</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I usually give up after getting stuck on a puzzle for a while,but will try to make it all the way to the end this time. Iâ€™m using ruby this year and you can check my solutions in this <a href="https://github.com/iprlic/AdventOfCode2019">repo</a>.</p>
