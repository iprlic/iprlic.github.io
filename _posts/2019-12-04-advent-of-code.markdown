I'm doing [Advent of code][advent] this year again ðŸŽ„ 


> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.


I usually give up after getting stuck on a puzzle for a while,but will try to make it all the way to the end this time. I'm using ruby this year and you can check my solutions in this [repo][repo].
